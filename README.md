## 📌 Overview
This project is developed as part of the **Python Development Internship at Codveda Technology**.  
It is a **Python script (`api_integration.py`) that integrates with the CoinGecko API** to fetch real-time cryptocurrency prices and save them in a CSV file.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Fetches **live cryptocurrency prices** from CoinGecko API.  
- Supports multiple cryptocurrencies at once (e.g., `bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin`).  
- Supports multiple fiat currencies (e.g., `usd`, `inr`, `eur`).  
- Saves results into a CSV file (`crypto_prices.csv`) with timestamps.  
- Handles API errors and invalid inputs gracefully.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Requests** (for API calls)  
- **CSV** (for saving results)  
- **Datetime** (for timestamps)
